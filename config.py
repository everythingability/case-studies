'''
For example, if your project is in a folder called "case-studies" like this:

/Library/WebServer/Documents/case-studies,

,,,your root will be /case-studies/ 

This is the folder where you store your Markdown.md files and where the HTML files (with the same name will be made.)

You can then use:
http://localhost/case-studies/

... to access your site.

Don't create an index.md file, because the index.html linking to all the other files will be created. As will tags.html.
